# Sleeper Clone – Fantasy Football Web App

This is a work-in-progress fantasy football web app inspired by Sleeper. I'm building it as a learning project to gain real-world experience with full-stack development, multiplayer architecture, and real-time systems.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build an MVP fantasy football platform for a single league
- Implement real-time draft, matchup scheduling, and scoring
- Use Firebase or a custom backend for authentication and data
- Explore Elixir and Phoenix for scalable backend features
- Document my progress weekly via blog

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (Vite)
- **Backend**: Firebase Functions or Node.js (early), Elixir/Phoenix (later)
- **Database**: Firestore or PostgreSQL
- **Real-time**: Firebase listeners or Socket.io
- **API**: Sleeper Public API
- **Hosting**: Vercel + Render

## ✅ Features (MVP)

- User registration and login
- Create/join league
- Snake-style draft system
- Set weekly lineup
- Matchups and standings
- Manual or API-based scoring

## 🚧 Features (Future)

- Live chat
- Trades and waivers
- Commissioner tools
- Multi-league support

## 🧠 Why I'm Building This

I’m using this project to:
- Build my coding portfolio
- Practice scalable backend and real-time systems
- Prepare for roles like backend engineer/developer
- Document my growth as a developer
